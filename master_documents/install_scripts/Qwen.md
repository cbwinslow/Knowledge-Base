# Ubuntu Server Setup Project

## Overview
This directory contains a comprehensive Ubuntu server setup project with networking tools, security configurations, and essential services. It provides a complete infrastructure for server operations with documentation and automation scripts.

## Directory Structure
- `run_complete_setup.sh` - Master server setup script
- `verify_setup.sh` - Verification script
- `README.md` - Project overview
- `networking/` - Networking configurations (proxy, ZeroTier, WireGuard)
- `services/` - Service configurations and management
- `security/` - Security configurations (SSH, firewall)
- `docs/` - Documentation and setup guides
- Numerous specialized setup directories for different components and platforms

## Key Components

### Networking Tools
- Squid Proxy Server (Port 3128)
- ZeroTier VPN networking
- WireGuard secure connections
- SSH security enhancements
- Firewall (UFW) configuration

### Essential Services
- Docker & Docker Compose container platform
- Nginx Web Server
- Certbot for SSL certificates
- Node.js Runtime
- Python3-pip Package Manager
- fail2ban Security Tool
- logrotate Log Management

### Security Configurations
- SSH configured for key-based authentication only
- Password authentication disabled
- Firewall with essential ports configured
- fail2ban intrusion prevention

## Installation Process
The master script (`run_complete_setup.sh`) orchestrates the installation in sequence:
1. Networking tools and services setup
2. Essential services installation
3. ZeroTier documentation
4. WireGuard documentation

## Documentation
Documentation is automatically generated and stored in the `docs/` directory:
- Setup summary with all components and configurations
- Service management instructions
- Configuration guides
- Troubleshooting tips
- Next steps recommendations

## Current Status
Based on the documentation:
- ✅ SSH (Secure Shell)
- ✅ Squid Proxy Server
- ✅ ZeroTier VPN
- ✅ Docker Container Platform
- ✅ Nginx Web Server
- ✅ fail2ban Security Tool
- ✅ Ansible Automation Tool
- ✅ Node.js Runtime
- ⚠️ Python pip package manager (missing)
- ⚠️ WireGuard VPN (needs installation)
- ⚠️ Firewall (UFW) not active

## Next Steps
1. Install missing components (Python pip, WireGuard)
2. Enable and configure firewall
3. Configure ZeroTier network
4. Set up WireGuard (if needed)
5. Run final verification

## Purpose
This server setup provides a complete, secure, and well-documented foundation for Ubuntu server operations, including networking, security, and essential services. It's designed to be easily reproducible and maintainable with comprehensive documentation.
