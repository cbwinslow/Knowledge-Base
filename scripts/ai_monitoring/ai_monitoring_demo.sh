echo

echo "5. DEPLOYMENT INFORMATION:"
echo "   To deploy the full system, run:"
echo "   sudo /home/cbwinslow/setup_ai_monitoring.sh"
echo
echo "   This will create services accessible at:"
echo "   - Grafana: http://localhost:3000"
echo "   - Prometheus: http://localhost:9090"
echo "   - OpenSearch: http://localhost:9200"
echo "   - Graylog: http://localhost:9000"
