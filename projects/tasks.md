# Tasks Management

This file contains documentation about how tasks are managed in this knowledge base.

## Task Management Principles

1. **Use todo_write tool proactively** for complex, multi-step tasks
2. **Track progress** with pending, in_progress, and completed states
3. **Break down complex tasks** into smaller, manageable steps
4. **Complete one task at a time** before moving to the next

## Task States

- **pending**: Task not yet started
- **in_progress**: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
- **completed**: Task finished successfully

## Best Practices

- Update task status in real-time as you work
- Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing
- Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
- Remove tasks that are no longer relevant
